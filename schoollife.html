    <A NAME="clubs"></A><h2>Clubs<h2>
      <h3>Math Team</h3>
        <p>For both sophomore and junior year, and hopefully senior year as well, I have been an executive<br>
          board member of math team, as well as participating in contests throughout the year.</p>

      <h3>Weiqi Club</h3>
        <p>During my sophomore year, I, along with three friends, founded our own club. Weiqi, also known as<br>
          "Go", is a Chinese board game that relies solely on strategy. I, the Treasurer, manage purchase of<br>
          boards and game pieces, as well as snacks for every meeting!</p>

      <h3>Green Team</h3>
        <p>We manage the recycling for the entire school, ensuring that people know what is recyclable and<br>
          what isn't.</p>

      <h3>Student Government Association</h3>
        <p>During my freshman year, I was elected as the Treasurer for the class of 2020. Throughout the year,<br>
          I helped raise over $1000. I decided not to run again so I could focus on my studies, having decided<br>
          to take AP Chemistry my sophomore year.</p>

      <h3>Harry Potter Club</h3>
        <p>Harry Potter has always been one of my series, and this club was the first one I joined. We discuss the<br>
          series and do activities related to it.</p>

      <h3>Drama Club</h3>
        <p>I auditioned for both the play and the musical my freshman year. During the play, She Kills Monsters,<br>
          I learned stage fighting, specifically fighting with swords. However, I did not get cast in the musical,<br>
          Fame (I've never been a great singer). In my sophomore year, I decided to not audition for the play as I<br>
          wanted to focus on my classes.</p>
